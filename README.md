Title: Desktop Assistance

"This will automate desktop functions to the fullest extent possible!"

Before opening the Desktop_assistant.py file, ensure you've downloaded all the required libraries mentioned in requirements.txt.

To install requirements.txt, type pip install -r requirements.txt in the terminal.

This program can perform various tasks, such as opening applications, creating folders, accessing the camera, opening web browsers, displaying the time, recording and saving videos, taking photos, creating and editing text files, browsing YouTube, and, last but not least, engaging in conversation similar to interacting with a human. Additionally, it includes a microphone option for recording and searching through voice commands.

Below are sample user commands:

open youtube: to open YouTube in your default browser
search on youtube ghosts: to search for "ghosts" on YouTube
search on google ghost: to search for "ghosts" on Google
create file hello its content: creates a new text file with the content "hello its content"
capture photo: to take a photo
record video: to start recording a video
make folder new_folder: to create a new folder named "new_folder"
what's the time: to know the current time
Additionally, during this hackathon, we attempted to develop a hand detector and gesture identifier.
